; Scatter-file for Cortex-M1 bare-metal example

; This scatter-file places the vector table, application code, data, stacks and heap at suitable addresses in the memory map.

; The vector table is placed first at the start of the image.
; Code starts after the last entry in the vector table.
; Data is placed at an address that must correspond to RAM.
; Stack and Heap are placed using ARM_LIB_STACKHEAP, to eliminate the need to set stack-base or heap-base in the debugger.
; System Control Space registers appear at their architecturally-defined addresses, based at 0xE000E000.
