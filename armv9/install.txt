EXAMPLES INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS - ARM DEVELOPMENT STUDIO
-----------------------------------------------------------
Examples are provided in zip files that are located in the 'examples' folder in the Development Studio installation. Other optional examples can be downloaded from the 'Downloads' page of https://developer.arm.com.

USING THE EXAMPLES IN ARM DEVELOPMENT STUDIO
--------------------------------------------
The zip files contain project files that you can import into the workspace of Arm Development Studio.
To import the examples into Arm Development Studio:
1. Launch "Arm Development Studio"
2. Select "File -> Import..." to open the Import Selection dialog.
3. Expand the "Arm Development Studio" group and select "Examples and Programming Libraries".
4. Click "Next" to open the "Import Development Studio Examples and Programming Libraries" dialog.
5. Expand the "Examples" group to view the example categories.
6. Either select one (or more) of the example categories to import, or expand the example categories to view/select individual examples in each category.
7. Click "Finish" to import the selected examples into your workspace.


USING THE EXAMPLES ON THE COMMAND-LINE
--------------------------------------
Unzip the full content of the zip file to a writable folder on your computer such as Documents or your home directory, because the Development Studio installation root directory is read only.
Refer to the readme for information on how to select the appropriate compiler before (re)building an example at the command prompt with make.
